# Python Pet Hotel

This is an app that allows the user to track pets in a hotel. The user can add, delete, and update the status of the pet in the hotel. The pet hotel consists of two views. The first allows the user to add a pet and view all current pets at the hotel. They can delete the pet and have the option to toggle between checking in and checking their pet out. The second view allows the user to add a pet owner as well as viewing the owners that currently have their pets checked into the hotel.
